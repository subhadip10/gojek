- Problem Statement:

We have a lot of driver partners on our platform. Whenever they are online, we get pings from their mobile phone every 15 seconds indicating that they are available.
You have been provided with 3 weeks (1 Jun 2017 to 21 Jun 2017) of training data and 1 week (22 Jun 2017 to 28 Jun 2017) of test data.
Training data contains driver id, gender, age, number of kids the driver has and all the pings that have been received (during the training data period).
