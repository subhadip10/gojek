Gojek Assignment

APPROACH:
•	Calculate Online Hours for drivers for each date by summarising Ping data
o	1st grouping with respect to driver_id, date and hour of that date.
o	Calculating number of pings in a specific hour of a day
o	Multiplying number of pings with 15 since each ping is at an interval of 15 sec
o	dividing the sum of all seconds by 3600 to convert to hours
o	Rounding of the hours to calculate online_hours.
•	Feature Engineering
o	Calculate Features for summarised Online_hours like
	Mean
	Median
	1st quantile
	2nd quantile
	Max
	Min
	Range
	Gender wise mean hours
o	Generate features for Date
	Day of year
	Day of Week
	Day of Month
•	Combining Generated features with driver details data
•	Checking for driver ids in both training and test data
•	Checking for missing data
•	Checking for duplicate records
•	Write a function to generate features for both train and test and then split back to train , test.
•	Training baseline linear regression model which gives predicts the mean online hours
o	MSE-7.56
•	To improve the predictions train Random Forest and Gradient Boosted trees.
•	Grid search in order to find the optimal parameter for the models
o	GBM(grid search with 3 fold cross validation accuracy)
	no of trees
	learning rate
	Max depth of trees
o	MSE-7.16
o	For Random forest(grid search with 3 fold cross validation accuracy)
	Max depth of trees
	Number of trees
o	MSE-7.2
•	Training RF and GBM with best parameters on training data and predicting using both the model
•	Taking mean of both the prediction
•	Imputing the prediction with 0 for drivers present in test but not in train
o	MSE-7.1
CHALLENGE:
•	There are lot of duplicate values present in both train and test data
•	Online hours distribution is different in train and test
•	More data required for training to capture the variation in weeks
